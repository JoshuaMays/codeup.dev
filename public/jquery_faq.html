                <h1>National Parks FAQ</h1>
                <dl>
                    <dt>1. <dfn>By "park" do you mean "parking lot"?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>No. A national park is "an area of land that is owned 
                        and protected by a national government because of its natural 
                        beauty or its importance to history or science."<br>
                        <cite><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/national%20park">Merriam Webster</a></cite>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>2. <dfn>Say I'm really into a specific park, and would like to 
                        purchase one. How may I go about this?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>Currently, you cannot purchase a national park from the government. 
                        But, give it ten years and we may have another response.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>3. <dfn>What if I told you there was oil under one said park?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>Oh, well in that case, we might be able to work something out. You know, 
                        under the table. wink wink.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>4. <dfn>Can I live in a national park?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>No. Although some parks offer camping areas, these are reserved 
                        for only temporary stays. You may not take up permanent residence.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>5. <dfn>I heard there are lots of animals in these "parks." Are they 
                        in cages or do you let them roam around wild, causin' up a ruckus?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>I think you're thinking of a "zoo." Have you ever heard of a wildlife preserve? 
                        It's kind of like that but better. And the animals may be wild, but, for the most
                        part, they are not dangerous. We offer literature and guidance at the parks' Visitor's 
                        Offices on how to best avoid being eaten alive, or attacked and left for dead.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>6. <dfn>Does Smokey Bear help protect park visitors?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>Smokey Bear is not real. He is a marketing tool to educate the public about the dangers 
                        of forest fires and to help prevent wildfires. He's an animated character. And, I guess, 
                        sometimes a guy in a mascot costume. Bears don't talk, or wear hats, or carry shovels.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>7. <dfn>Should I be worried about Yogi Bear stealing my picnic basket?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>Really? Again, Yogi Bear is an animated character. He's not a real bear. He lives in a fictional 
                        cartoon fantasy land, inside the magical color box in your living room. And just to nip this in the 
                        bud--other famous bears that are not real: Boo-Boo Bear, Paddington Bear, and Winnie-the-Pooh. 
                    </dd>
                    <dt>8. <dfn>Can I wear a furry costume and jump out of the bushes and scare people?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd> Please don't. Just don't. If we catch you doing this, not only will you be banned for life from
                        the park in which you're being a nuisance, but you will be banned from all national parks. Forever. 
                        Even if you die and are reincarnated, we will find you and ban your new self. Even if you are reincarnated
                        as a wild animal, if you're reborn in a national park, we will find you and kick you out, forcing you to
                        live your life as an animal on the run. Bouncing between suburban trashcan to suburban trashcan.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>9. <dfn>So are these national parks completely joyless areas?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>Yes, if you consider spending time in some of the most naturally beautiful stretches of land in the known
                        universe to be a joyless activity. Maybe this isn't really meant for you. Have you tried the travelling carnivals?
                    </dd>
                    <dt>10. <dfn>How do I become a park ranger?</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>If you're the person who has asked the previous nine questions, I don't know what a park ranger is. 
                        Never heard of it. Are you talking about ranger in the sense of Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings?
                        For everyone else: visit the national park services <a href="http://www.nps.gov/personnel">personnel</a> page
